Homestuck is an Internet fiction series created by American author and artist Andrew Hussie. The fourth and best-known of Hussie's four MS Paint Adventures, it originally ran from April 13, 2009, to April 13, 2016. Though normally described as a webcomic, and partly constituted by a series of single panel pages, Homestuck also relied heavily on Flash animations and instant message logs to convey its story, along with the occasional use of browser games.
<p>
Its plot centers on a group of teens who trigger the inevitable destruction of Earth by installing the beta version of an upcoming PC game, Sburb. The teens soon come into contact with a group of Internet trolls who are revealed to be horned aliens, and these trolls work with the kids to create a new universe by completing the game. It has been noted for its complex and nonlinear plot, considerable length at over 8,000 pages and 800,000 words, and intensely devoted fan community.
<p>
The success of Homestuck has resulted in numerous related projects and sequels, including the Hiveswap series of adventure games.
